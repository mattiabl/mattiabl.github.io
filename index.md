title: About Me
---

I am an engineer by training and a data scientist by profession working on digital health topics. I contributed to build commercial wearables, [medical grade wearable solutions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937478/) and [Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)](https://floodlightms-us.com/) to monitor metabolic (diabetes), cardiovascular and neurodegenerative (Multiple Sclerosis) diseases. In a previous life I also worked on virtual metrology topics applied to manufactoring processes and I built electrical circuits for robotics and automation.
