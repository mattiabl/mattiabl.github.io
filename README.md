Welcome to Mattia Zanon's personal webpage, where you can find information regarding my professional profile. The content can be found on-line, I have just collected it here in a centralized space for convenince. 

## Credits
This website is based on **Jekyll**, a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)) and using as theme **Jekyll Now*, that "makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup" ([Jekyll Now Repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/)).
