I am an engineer by training and a data/research scientist by profession, working for most of my career on digital health topics. I used, and contributed to build, several (medical grade) wearable sensors to study metabolic (diabetes), cardiovascular and neurodegenerative (Multiple Sclerosis) diseases. In a previous life, I have also spent some time working on virtual metrology applied to manufactoring processes.
